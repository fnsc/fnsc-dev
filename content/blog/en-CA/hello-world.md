## Why a blog?

After years of working as a developer, I've built up quite a collection of notes, opinions, and lessons learned the hard way. This blog is my way of putting those thoughts in order and sharing them with others.

## What to expect

I'm planning to write about:

- **Backend architecture** — patterns, trade-offs, and real-world examples
- **Testing culture** — why I think automated testing is a superpower
- **Open source** — maintaining my own projects and contributing to others
- **Career growth** — navigating the jump from junior to senior

## Let's chat

If any of these topics sound interesting, feel free to [get in touch](mailto:gabrieldfnsc@gmail.com). I'd love to hear what you think.

Stay tuned for more!
